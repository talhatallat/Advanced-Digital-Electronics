# Comparator lab 1
Basic design flow

## Overall Feedback
1. The VHDL source code and testbench are missing
2. All figures need to be labelled, numbered and need a caption. 
3. The configuration is not shown.
4. There are some tables missing that were to be filled out.


_A good report **60%** (a 3)._


## Note
More work is required!
